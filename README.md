## Overview of the Analysis
The propose of the report is to explain if the model that we create with the data that Alphabet Soup Foundation give us have the accuracy neccesary to select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. For this, we make to models. 

The first neural network model use two hidden layers with 80 nodes and 30 nodes respectively, and in both layers we use the activation model "relu". finally, we use 100 epochs to test the model.

The secondneural network model use three hidden layers with 100, 60 and 60 nodes respectively, and to the first layers, we use the activation model "relu" and to the others we used sigmoid activation model. Finally, we use 100 epochs to test the model.

## Results

* Data Preprocessing
    * Tarjet variables
    * Features variables
    * Variables that we didnt used.

* Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
    * Details of the models
    * Achieve the tarjet?
    * improve the model performance

## Summary
If you can see compare the graph of loss and accuracy for the models, both have a similar loss with 53% of the data,
